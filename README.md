# fifth-challenge-repo

in this challenge i was able to make a function calender that would allow people to save tast in certain time slot and it would stay in local storage regardless if page was refreshed or closed.

i applied the dayjs() code that allowed me to display the time and date at the top of the page. 

i also added classes to give each hour a color dependant on what time of the day it was.

Thank you!
